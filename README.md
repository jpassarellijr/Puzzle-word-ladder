Puzzle - Word Ladder
======================


Solution applied to solve the problem
-------------------

First I tried to reduce the universe of words in the dictionary by applying some size filters, single words that contain at least one of the letters of the beginning and ending word.

Then comes the process of creating the word ladder where I worked with queues and Breadth First Search for a graph.
